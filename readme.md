# Vador Project
## Welcome
**Vador Project** is a free and open-source project that lists various free and open-source software directly from their official websites.
## How it works
Just go to [this site](https://enioaiello.github.io/vador) and do your research! Or you can use the free [Admin Services edition]([https://enioaiello.github.io/admin-services/views/apps/vador.html](https://enioaiello.github.io/admin-services/views/applications/vador))!
> Beware! Some softwares are not yet listed, send me a mail [here](mailto:aielloenio@icloud.com) to submit your software!
## Thanks
Thanks to **ChatGPT** who helped me a lot for the functioning of the site or for some software.
